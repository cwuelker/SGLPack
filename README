Dear user,


Thank you very much for your interest in our fast SGL Fourier transforms. To use our Matlab implementation on your system, please follow these instructions:

1. Download the entire repository 'SGLPack' from GitHub.

2. Use Matlabs 'mex' function to build 'R_mex.c' in folder 'FSGLFT' (if using Matlabs MEX is not convenient for you, simply exchange the function 'R_mex' by the function 'R' where needed).

3. Use the script 'example_script.m' to test whether the software works correctly on your system. For this purpose, just set your local path in line 36, choose a bandwidth B in line 52, and run the script in Matlab.

Please note that the provided software works with bandwidths B = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. If you would like to work with higher bandwidths (up to B = 64 is possible) or other bandwidths than the powers of 2, I can provide you with the necessary precomputed data.

In our implementation, the function values are currently stored in a 2B x 2B x 2B array, using the indices i, j, k as in the paper (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.05140.pdf); the SGL Fourier coefficients are stored in a B x B x 2B-1 array, using the indices n, l, m as demonstrated in lines 91–101 of the example script.

Finally, note that 'FSGLFT.m' and 'iFSGLFT.m' are the fast SGL Fourier transforms described in the paper; 'FSGLFT_Clenshaw.m' and 'iFSGLFT_Clenshaw.m' are improved versions.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.


With kind regards,
