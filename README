14/05/17 NEWS! This is the new C++ version of our fast SGL Fourier transforms. You can still download the Matlab version here: http://www.math.uni-luebeck.de/mitarbeiter/wuelker/SGLPack_matlab.zip. The new C++ implementation uses SpharmonicKit (see http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~geelong/sphere for further information).


Dear user,


Thank you very much for your interest in our fast SGL Fourier transforms. 

In order to test our C++ implementation on your system, please follow these instructions:

1. Download the entire repository 'SGLPack' from GitHub.

2. Install SpharmonicKit (include/SpharmonicKit27.zip) on your system.

3. Set your path preferences in cmake/CMakeLists.txt, then run cmake (>> cmake cmake).

4. Build the example program (>> make all).

5. Run the example program (>> ./SGLPack).

SGLPack currently works with bandwidths B = 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. The function values are stored in a three-dimensional array, using the indices i, j, k as in the paper (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.05140.pdf); the SGL Fourier coefficients are stored in three-dimensional array as well, using the indices n, l, m as demonstrated in line 105 of example.cpp. Please note that there is only as much space allocated as required, i.e., no space is wasted by using three-dimensional arrays.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.


With kind regards,
